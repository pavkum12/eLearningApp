      "Firstly, let me tell you. I did not have a plan when I started out. Rather I was full of insecurities, doubts and fears (only 2 attempts to give owing to age factors and the possibility of failure). Then, I picked bits and pieces from different people’s strategies. After going through peoples’ startegies, I tried to do what I felt were genuine and honest suggestion by them. Further, different people have different backgrounds. Just to elaborate, I had working knowledge of Economics as I have done MBA Finance, so perhaps I was comfortable with Economy without reading 11th and 12th NCERTs or Ramesh Singh. I only did Sri Ram printed Economics notes . So, design your strategy accordingly.",

      "Hi all! I’m Saumya Sharma, and I have secured AIR 9 in UPSC CSE 2017 in my very first attempt at the age of 23 (I was 22 when I wrote the exam). I formally started my UPSC preparation on 19 February 2017, four months before the prelims, when I was in my final semester at National Law University, Delhi. My optional was law, for which I started preparing only after writing prelims. I did not take any coaching, but I joined many many test series. During the mains examination week, I was down with viral fever. My fever was not subsiding below 102, at times touching 103. I was lucky enough to have doctors for parents who ensured I got saline drip infusion thrice a day, including in the lunch break between the papers.",

      "Hello Everyone, As it is said, ”Dreams Don’t Work Unless you do”. The dream of becoming an IAS, which many of us desire to be a reality requires Hard work, Consistency, Absolute Commitment from our side and a Positive Attitude. I am going to share my strategy with you guys, which i hope will be beneficial for you. I started my preparation early in my 4th year of Engineering. Starting early has its advantages, so you all can also try to begin your journey towards your Dream at an early stage. Starting with the basics i feel one must be consciously aware about the syllabus of the UPSC Civil Services Examination. By consciously i mean, one should be able to identify if a particular Topic/News is covered in our syllabus by just a Glance over the Topic/News.",
